            <h4>Announcing the Autumn 2020 Hayden Distinguished Speakers</h4>
            <p>In Autumn 2020, the Yale School of Art will welcome four Hayden Distinguished Speakers: Angela Y. Davis, Hortense Spillers, Stefano Harney, and Fred Moten. Initially launched in 2017, this speakership, generously made possible by the Hayden Fund for Art and Ideas, will continue to bring globally recognized leaders in art and the academy to Yale to work with students as teachers, mentors, and critics. Past Hayden Distinguished Fellows include Andrea Fraser, Peter Osborne, Carol Bove, Richard Hawkins, and Hito Steyerl, as well as past Hayden Distinguished Visiting Artist Jessica Stockholder.</p>

            <h4>A Message from Dean Kuzma</h4>
            <p>Dear Members of the School of Art Community,    
              I have had the honor to serve as the first woman Dean of the School of Art, and now to enter the fifth year of that term upon the 150th anniversary of the School of Art’s founding and its enrollment of the first women at Yale University. My experience has been enriching, given the opportunities to lead, to teach, and to befriend some of the most engaging and dynamic young artists—artists who will soon become colleagues, co-teachers, and, most likely, my mentors. As I commence this fifth year, I have decided not to seek reappointment as Dean after my initial term, ending June 2021. At that point, I look forward to stepping into my full-time role as tenured Professor of Art at the Yale School of Art.   </p>
